## Accepted Papers
* [Hierarchical Expertise Level Modeling for User Specific Contrastive Explanations](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/0671.pdf)

    Authors - Sarath Sreedharan, Siddharth Srivastava, Subbarao Kambhampati

    Abstract - There is a growing interest within the AI research
    community in developing autonomous systems capable
    of explaining their behavior to users. However,
    the problem of computing explanations for
    users of different levels of expertise has received
    little research attention. We propose an approach
    for addressing this problem by representing the
    user’s understanding of the task as an abstraction
    of the domain model that the planner uses. We
    present algorithms for generating minimal explanations
    in cases where this abstract human model
    is not known. We reduce the problem of generating
    an explanation to a search over the space of abstract
    models and show that while the complete problem
    is NP-hard, a greedy algorithm can provide good
    approximations of the optimal solution. We also
    empirically show that our approach can efficiently
    compute explanations for a variety of problems.

* [Extracting Action Sequences from Texts Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2018/0565.pdf)

    Authors - Wenfeng Feng, Hankz Hankui Zhuo, Subbarao Kambhampati

    Abstract - Extracting action sequences from texts is challenging,
    as it requires commonsense inferences based
    on world knowledge. Although there has been
    work on extracting action scripts, instructions, navigation
    actions, etc., they require either the set of
    candidate actions be provided in advance, or action
    descriptions are restricted to a specific form,
    e.g., description templates. In this paper we aim
    to extract action sequences from texts in free natural
    language, i.e., without any restricted templates,
    provided the set of actions is unknown. We propose
    to extract action sequences from texts based on the
    deep reinforcement learning framework. Specifically,
    we view “selecting” or “eliminating” words
    from texts as “actions”, and texts associated with
    actions as “states”. We build Q-networks to learn
    policies of extracting actions and extract plans from
    the labeled texts. We demonstrate the effectiveness
    of our approach on several datasets with comparison
    to state-of-the-art approaches

    Status - Accepted for the Main Track and published in Proceedings in Natural Language section.
