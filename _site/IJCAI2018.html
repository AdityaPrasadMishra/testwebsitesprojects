    <p>Authors - Sarath Sreedharan, Siddharth Srivastava, Subbarao Kambhampati</p>

    <p>Abstract - There is a growing interest within the AI research
  community in developing autonomous systems capable
  of explaining their behavior to users. However,
  the problem of computing explanations for
  users of different levels of expertise has received
  little research attention. We propose an approach
  for addressing this problem by representing the
  user’s understanding of the task as an abstraction
  of the domain model that the planner uses. We
  present algorithms for generating minimal explanations
  in cases where this abstract human model
  is not known. We reduce the problem of generating
  an explanation to a search over the space of abstract
  models and show that while the complete problem
  is NP-hard, a greedy algorithm can provide good
  approximations of the optimal solution. We also
  empirically show that our approach can efficiently
  compute explanations for a variety of problems.</p>

    <p>Authors - Wenfeng Feng, Hankz Hankui Zhuo, Subbarao Kambhampati</p>

    <p>Abstract - Extracting action sequences from texts is challenging,
  as it requires commonsense inferences based
  on world knowledge. Although there has been
  work on extracting action scripts, instructions, navigation
  actions, etc., they require either the set of
  candidate actions be provided in advance, or action
  descriptions are restricted to a specific form,
  e.g., description templates. In this paper we aim
  to extract action sequences from texts in free natural
  language, i.e., without any restricted templates,
  provided the set of actions is unknown. We propose
  to extract action sequences from texts based on the
  deep reinforcement learning framework. Specifically,
  we view “selecting” or “eliminating” words
  from texts as “actions”, and texts associated with
  actions as “states”. We build Q-networks to learn
  policies of extracting actions and extract plans from
  the labeled texts. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  of our approach on several datasets with comparison
  to state-of-the-art approaches</p>
